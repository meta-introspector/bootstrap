# Bootstrap Stage0 - Flow-Based Structure

## Overview

The bootstrap stage0 system is constructed as **flows** where each type is a **potential flow** in a Navier-Stokes equation. Each module is a **vector field**, each function is a **flow operation**, and the system is a **higher-order potential flow**.

## Flow Architecture

### Core Principle
- **Each type = a potential flow**
- **Each file = a vector field**
- **Each function = a flow operation**
- **Each module = a flow component**
- **The system = a higher-order potential flow**

### File Structure

```
src/
├── hash.rs         // Hash potential flow
├── artifact.rs     // Artifact potential flow  
├── storage.rs      // Storage potential flow
├── kernel.rs       // Kernel potential flow
├── system.rs       // System potential flow
└── lib.rs          // Unified flow field
```

## Individual Flow Types

### 1. `hash.rs` - Hash Potential Flow
**Purpose**: Content identification through hash space

```rust
pub struct Hash([u8; 32]);
```

- **Flow Field**: Hash space where content converges
- **Flow Operator**: `hash_flow(data) -> Hash`
- **Gradient**: `gradient() -> Vec<u8>`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a potential in content identification field

### 2. `artifact.rs` - Artifact Potential Flow
**Purpose**: Content storage and materialization

```rust
pub struct Artifact {
    pub hash: Hash,
    pub content: Vec<u8>,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Storage space where content materializes
- **Flow Operator**: `artifact_flow(content) -> Artifact`
- **Divergence**: `divergence() -> usize`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a potential in content storage field

### 3. `storage.rs` - Storage Potential Flow
**Purpose**: Storage field operations

```rust
pub struct Storage {
    field: HashMap<Hash, Artifact>,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Field of storage potentials where artifacts converge
- **Flow Operator**: `storage_flow() -> Storage`
- **Curl**: `field_curl() -> usize`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a field of storage potentials

### 4. `kernel.rs` - Kernel Potential Flow
**Purpose**: System coordination and cycle management

```rust
pub struct Kernel {
    storage: Storage,
    cycle: u64,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Central coordination field where all flows converge
- **Flow Operator**: `kernel_flow() -> Kernel`
- **Divergence**: `system_divergence() -> usize`
- **Mathematical**: Represents the central coordination potential

### 5. `system.rs` - System Potential Flow
**Purpose**: Complete bootstrap system as unified flow field

```rust
pub struct System {
    kernel: Kernel,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Unified flow field where all potentials converge
- **Flow Operator**: `system_flow() -> System`
- **Curl**: `system_curl() -> u64`
- **Mathematical**: Higher-order potential that coordinates all sub-flows

## Flow Operations

### Hash Flow
```rust
pub fn hash_flow(data: &[u8]) -> Hash
```
Transforms content flow into hash potential

### Artifact Flow
```rust
pub fn artifact_flow(content: Vec<u8>) -> Artifact
```
Transforms content into artifact potential

### Storage Flow
```rust
pub fn storage_flow() -> Storage
```
Transforms storage operations into storage potentials

### Kernel Flow
```rust
pub fn kernel_flow() -> Kernel
```
Transforms system operations into kernel potentials

### System Flow
```rust
pub fn system_flow() -> System
```
Transforms system operations into unified system potentials

## Mathematical Foundation

### Navier-Stokes Analogy
Each type represents a potential flow in a Navier-Stokes equation:

1. **Hash**: Potential in content identification field
2. **Artifact**: Potential in content storage field  
3. **Storage**: Field of storage potentials
4. **Kernel**: Central coordination potential
5. **System**: Higher-order potential flow

### Flow Properties
- **Gradient**: Rate of change in potential
- **Divergence**: Flow source/sink strength
- **Curl**: Vorticity of the flow field
- **Potential**: Scalar field from which flow derives

### 42-Step Cycle
The system operates on a 42-step cycle, representing:
- **Flow periodicity**: The system returns to initial state every 42 operations
- **Potential cycling**: Each operation advances the cycle potential
- **Field evolution**: The flow field evolves through 42 distinct states

## Benefits of Flow-Based Design

### 1. **Mathematical Consistency**
- Each type has well-defined mathematical properties
- Flow operations are composable and predictable
- System behavior follows fluid dynamics principles

### 2. **Modularity**
- Each flow type is independent and self-contained
- Flow operations can be combined in various ways
- Clear separation of concerns through flow boundaries

### 3. **Extensibility**
- New flow types can be added as new potentials
- Flow operations can be extended with new capabilities
- System can evolve while maintaining flow properties

### 4. **Analyzability**
- Flow properties can be measured and analyzed
- System behavior can be predicted using flow dynamics
- Performance characteristics follow flow patterns

## Usage Example

```rust
use bootstrap::Bootstrap;

// Create a new bootstrap flow field
let mut bootstrap = Bootstrap::new();

// Store content in the flow
let content = b"Hello, Flow World!".to_vec();
let hash = bootstrap.store(content);

// Retrieve content from the flow
let retrieved = bootstrap.retrieve(&hash);

// Check flow properties
let divergence = bootstrap.total_divergence();
let curl = bootstrap.curl();
let cycle = bootstrap.cycle_step();
```

## Conclusion

This flow-based architecture provides a mathematically sound foundation for the bootstrap system, where each component is a potential flow in a unified field. The system behaves like a fluid dynamic system, with predictable flow patterns and composable operations.
