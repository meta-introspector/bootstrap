# Bootstrap Stage0 - Mathematical Foundations

## Overview

The Bootstrap Stage0 system is built on mathematical foundations from fluid dynamics, specifically **potential flow theory** and **Navier-Stokes equations**. Each type represents a potential flow in a mathematical field, with well-defined properties and behaviors.

## Potential Flow Theory

### Basic Concepts

#### Potential Function
A **potential function** φ(x,y,z) is a scalar field from which a vector field can be derived:
```
∇φ = (∂φ/∂x, ∂φ/∂y, ∂φ/∂z)
```

In our system, each type represents a potential function in its respective field.

#### Vector Field
A **vector field** F(x,y,z) represents the flow of some quantity through space:
```
F = (Fx, Fy, Fz)
```

#### Flow Properties
- **Gradient**: ∇φ - rate of change of potential
- **Divergence**: ∇·F - source/sink strength
- **Curl**: ∇×F - vorticity/rotation

## Flow Types as Mathematical Objects

### 1. Hash Flow - Content Identification Field

#### Mathematical Representation
```rust
pub struct Hash([u8; 32]);
```

#### Potential Function
The Hash type represents a potential function φₕ in content identification space:
```
φₕ: Content → HashSpace
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Gradient**: `∇φₕ` represents the rate of change in hash space
- **Flow Field**: 32-dimensional hash space
- **Convergence**: Content converges to unique hash potential
- **Uniqueness**: Each content has exactly one hash potential

#### Flow Operator
```rust
hash_flow(data) → Hash
```
This represents the mathematical operation:
```
φₕ(data) = hash(data)
```

### 2. Artifact Flow - Content Storage Field

#### Mathematical Representation
```rust
pub struct Artifact {
    pub hash: Hash,
    pub content: Vec<u8>,
}
```

#### Potential Function
The Artifact type represents a potential function φₐ in content storage space:
```
φₐ: Content → StorageSpace
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Divergence**: `∇·φₐ` represents content size/length
- **Materialization**: Content becomes concrete in storage space
- **Flow**: Content flows through storage dimensions
- **Binding**: Hash and content are bound together

#### Flow Operator
```rust
artifact_flow(content) → Artifact
```
This represents the mathematical operation:
```
φₐ(content) = (φₕ(content), content)
```

### 3. Storage Flow - Storage Potential Field

#### Mathematical Representation
```rust
pub struct Storage {
    field: HashMap<Hash, Artifact>,
}
```

#### Potential Function
The Storage type represents a potential field φₛ in storage space:
```
φₛ: HashSpace → ArtifactSpace
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Field**: φₛ is a field of storage potentials
- **Curl**: `∇×φₛ` represents the number of stored artifacts
- **Mapping**: Bijective mapping from hash to artifact
- **Convergence**: Artifacts converge in storage field

#### Flow Operator
```rust
storage_flow() → Storage
```
This represents the mathematical operation:
```
φₛ = {φₕ → φₐ | for all stored content}
```

### 4. Kernel Flow - System Coordination Field

#### Mathematical Representation
```rust
pub struct Kernel {
    storage: Storage,
    cycle: u64,
}
```

#### Potential Function
The Kernel type represents a potential function φₖ in system coordination space:
```
φₖ: SystemState → CoordinationSpace
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Potential**: Central coordination potential
- **Divergence**: `∇·φₖ` represents system complexity
- **Cycle**: 42-step periodic evolution
- **Coordination**: All flows converge at this potential

#### Flow Operator
```rust
kernel_flow() → Kernel
```
This represents the mathematical operation:
```
φₖ = (φₛ, cycle_state)
```

### 5. System Flow - Higher-Order Unified Field

#### Mathematical Representation
```rust
pub struct System {
    kernel: Kernel,
}
```

#### Potential Function
The System type represents a higher-order potential function φₛᵧ in unified system space:
```
φₛᵧ: AllFlows → UnifiedSystemSpace
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Higher-Order**: Coordinates all sub-flows
- **Curl**: `∇×φₛᵧ` represents system vorticity
- **Divergence**: `∇·φₛᵧ` represents total system complexity
- **Unification**: All potentials unified in single field

#### Flow Operator
```rust
system_flow() → System
```
This represents the mathematical operation:
```
φₛᵧ = φₖ
```

## 42-Step Cycle Mathematics

### Cyclic Evolution
The system operates on a 42-step cycle, representing a periodic evolution in the flow field:

#### Mathematical Representation
```
cycle(t) = t mod 42
```

#### Flow Evolution
Each operation advances the cycle:
```
φₖ(t+1) = φₖ(t) + 1 mod 42
```

#### Mathematical Properties
- **Periodicity**: System returns to initial state every 42 operations
- **Evolution**: Flow field evolves through 42 distinct states
- **Wrapping**: Cycle wraps around at 42 (modulo 42)
- **State Space**: 42-dimensional state space

### Cycle as Flow Property
The cycle represents a flow property in the system:
- **Vorticity**: Cycle state represents system vorticity
- **Evolution**: Each operation evolves the flow field
- **Periodicity**: Flow field is periodic with period 42
- **Stability**: System maintains stability through cycles

## Flow Composition Mathematics

### Composition Rules
Flow types can be composed following mathematical rules:

#### Sequential Composition
```
φ₂ ∘ φ₁ = φ₂(φ₁(x))
```

Example: `artifact_flow ∘ hash_flow`

#### Parallel Composition
```
φ₁ × φ₂ = (φ₁(x), φ₂(y))
```

Example: Hash and content stored together

#### Higher-Order Composition
```
φₕₒ(φ₁, φ₂, ..., φₙ) = unified_flow
```

Example: System coordinates all sub-flows

### Mathematical Consistency
All compositions maintain mathematical consistency:
- **Associativity**: `(φ₃ ∘ φ₂) ∘ φ₁ = φ₃ ∘ (φ₂ ∘ φ₁)`
- **Identity**: `φ ∘ id = id ∘ φ = φ`
- **Commutativity**: Some operations commute, others don't

## Error Handling Mathematics

### Error as Flow Disruption
Errors represent disruptions in the flow field:

#### StorageFlowError
```rust
pub enum StorageFlowError {
    FlowFailed,    // Flow disruption
    NotFound,      // Potential not found in field
}
```

#### Mathematical Representation
- **FlowFailed**: `∇·φ = ∞` (infinite divergence)
- **NotFound**: `φ(x) = ∅` (potential undefined)

## Performance Mathematics

### Flow Complexity
Each flow operation has well-defined complexity:

#### Hash Flow
- **Time**: O(n) where n is content size
- **Space**: O(1) - fixed 32-byte output
- **Flow**: Content → Hash potential

#### Artifact Flow
- **Time**: O(n) where n is content size
- **Space**: O(n) - stores content
- **Flow**: Content → Artifact potential

#### Storage Flow
- **Time**: O(1) average case (hash map)
- **Space**: O(k) where k is number of artifacts
- **Flow**: Artifact → Storage field

#### Kernel Flow
- **Time**: O(1) for cycle operations
- **Space**: O(k) where k is system complexity
- **Flow**: Content → System coordination

#### System Flow
- **Time**: O(1) for coordination
- **Space**: O(k) where k is total complexity
- **Flow**: All flows → Unified system
