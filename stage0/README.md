# Bootstrap Stage0 - Flow-Based Microkernel

## Overview

Bootstrap Stage0 is a minimal, self-contained microkernel constructed as **flows** where each type is a **potential flow** in a Navier-Stokes equation. Each module is a **vector field**, each function is a **flow operation**, and the system is a **higher-order potential flow**.

## Core Philosophy

### Flow-Based Architecture
- **Each type = a potential flow** in mathematical space
- **Each file = a vector field** with defined operations
- **Each function = a flow operation** that transforms data
- **Each module = a flow component** with specific responsibilities
- **The system = a higher-order potential flow** that coordinates all sub-flows

### Mathematical Foundation
The system is built on fluid dynamics principles where:
- **Gradient**: Rate of change in potential
- **Divergence**: Flow source/sink strength  
- **Curl**: Vorticity of the flow field
- **Potential**: Scalar field from which flow derives

### Flow Types

#### 1. Hash Flow (`hash.rs`)
**Purpose**: Content identification through hash space

```rust
pub struct Hash([u8; 32]);
```

- **Flow Field**: Hash space where content converges
- **Flow Operator**: `hash_flow(data) -> Hash`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a potential in content identification field
- **Properties**: Gradient, flow field, potential convergence

#### 2. Artifact Flow (`artifact.rs`)
**Purpose**: Content storage and materialization

```rust
pub struct Artifact {
    pub hash: Hash,
    pub content: Vec<u8>,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Storage space where content materializes
- **Flow Operator**: `artifact_flow(content) -> Artifact`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a potential in content storage field
- **Properties**: Divergence, content flow, materialization

#### 3. Storage Flow (`storage.rs`)
**Purpose**: Storage field operations

```rust
pub struct Storage {
    field: HashMap<Hash, Artifact>,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Field of storage potentials where artifacts converge
- **Flow Operator**: `storage_flow() -> Storage`
- **Mathematical**: Represents a field of storage potentials
- **Properties**: Curl, field operations, potential mapping

#### 4. Kernel Flow (`kernel.rs`)
**Purpose**: System coordination and cycle management

```rust
pub struct Kernel {
    storage: Storage,
    cycle: u64,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Central coordination field where all flows converge
- **Flow Operator**: `kernel_flow() -> Kernel`
- **Mathematical**: Represents the central coordination potential
- **Properties**: System divergence, cycle management, flow coordination

#### 5. System Flow (`system.rs`)
**Purpose**: Complete bootstrap system as unified flow field

```rust
pub struct System {
    kernel: Kernel,
}
```

- **Flow Field**: Unified flow field where all potentials converge
- **Flow Operator**: `system_flow() -> System`
- **Mathematical**: Higher-order potential that coordinates all sub-flows
- **Properties**: System curl, total divergence, unified coordination

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```rust
use bootstrap::Bootstrap;

// Create a new bootstrap flow field
let mut bootstrap = Bootstrap::new();

// Store content in the flow
let content = b"Hello, Flow World!".to_vec();
let hash = bootstrap.store(content);

// Retrieve content from the flow
let retrieved = bootstrap.retrieve(&hash);

// Check flow properties
let divergence = bootstrap.total_divergence();
let curl = bootstrap.curl();
let cycle = bootstrap.cycle_step();
```

### Advanced Flow Operations
```rust
use bootstrap::{Hash, Artifact, Storage, Kernel, System};

// Create individual flow components
let hash = Hash::from_flow(b"test data");
let artifact = Artifact::from_content_flow(b"content".to_vec());
let storage = Storage::new_field();
let kernel = Kernel::new_field();
let system = System::new_field();

// Perform flow operations
let new_hash = hash_flow(b"new data");
let new_artifact = artifact_flow(b"new content".to_vec());
```

## Mathematical Properties

### Flow Dynamics
Each flow type exhibits specific mathematical properties:

1. **Hash Flow**: Potential convergence, gradient computation
2. **Artifact Flow**: Content divergence, materialization
3. **Storage Flow**: Field curl, potential mapping
4. **Kernel Flow**: System divergence, cycle evolution
5. **System Flow**: Higher-order coordination, unified field

### 42-Step Cycle
The system operates on a 42-step cycle representing:
- **Flow periodicity**: System returns to initial state every 42 operations
- **Potential cycling**: Each operation advances the cycle potential
- **Field evolution**: Flow field evolves through 42 distinct states
