# Bootstrap Stage 0 - Microkernel Foundation

## Overview

Bootstrap Stage 0 is the core, dependency-free foundation of the solfunmeme-dioxus microkernel architecture. It implements a minimal, self-contained runtime environment that provides the essential building blocks for a content-addressable, extensible system.

## Core Philosophy

The stage0 microkernel embodies several key principles:

- **Minimalism**: Zero external dependencies, pure Rust with only std/core
- **Self-awareness**: The kernel understands its own structure and capabilities
- **Content-addressable**: All artifacts indexed by cryptographic hash
- **Extensible**: Clear interface for dynamic loading of external functionality
- **Deterministic**: Consistent behavior across environments
- **Univalence**: Explicit modeling of identity as transformation paths
- **Ouroboros Cycle**: 42-step self-renewal cycle

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Kernel** (`kernel.rs`): Central orchestrator managing the 42-step cycle
2. **Artifact** (`artifact.rs`): Content-addressable data units
3. **Hash** (`hash.rs`): Generic hash representation with pluggable algorithms
4. **Manifold** (`manifold.rs`): 8D geometric projection system
5. **Chord Store** (`chord.rs`): Distributed hash table for artifact storage
6. **Proof System** (`proof.rs`, `verifier.rs`): Cryptographic verification
7. **Univalence** (`univalence.rs`): Identity transformation tracking

### Key Concepts

#### Content-Addressable Storage
All data (`Artifact`s) is identified by the hash of its content, enabling:
- Deduplication through content hashing
- Immutable data references
- Cryptographic integrity verification

#### 8D Manifold Projection
Artifacts are mapped to coordinates on an 8-dimensional hypersphere, providing:
- Spatial representation of all data
- Geometric relationships between artifacts
- Scalable indexing mechanism

#### Ouroboros Cycle
The kernel operates on a 42-step cycle, advancing each time a component is rewritten:
- Symbolizes perpetual self-renewal
- Tracks system evolution through rewrite history
- Maintains identity through transformation paths

#### Univalence Implementation
The system explicitly models the Univalent Axiom by:
- Treating identity as a path of transformations
- Recording rewrite history as `EquivalenceProof`
- Maintaining continuity through component changes

## Usage

### Basic Example

```rust
use bootstrap_stage0::{
    Kernel, ChecksumHasher, DefaultProjector, DefaultProofVerifier
};

// Create a new kernel with default components
let mut kernel = Kernel::new(
    Box::new(DefaultProofVerifier),
    Box::new(DefaultProjector),
    Box::new(ChecksumHasher)
);

// Store an artifact
let content = b"Hello, World!".to_vec();
let hash = kernel.store_artifact(content).unwrap();

// Retrieve artifact coordinate on manifold
let coord = kernel.get_artifact_coordinate(&hash);
assert!(coord.is_some());

// Perform a rewrite (advances the cycle)
kernel.rewrite_hasher(Box::new(ChecksumHasher));
assert_eq!(kernel.step, 1);
```

### Component Replacement

```rust
// Replace the hasher (advances cycle)
kernel.rewrite_hasher(Box::new(NewHasher));

// Replace the projector (advances cycle)
kernel.rewrite_projector(Box::new(NewProjector));

// Check cycle position
println!("Current step: {}", kernel.step);
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
cd crates/bootstrap/stage0
cargo build
```

### Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

### Adding New Components

1. Implement the appropriate trait (`Hasher`, `ManifoldProjector`, etc.)
2. Create a new module for your component
3. Add it to `lib.rs` exports
4. Update the components manifest

## Design Decisions

### Why 42 Steps?
The 42-step cycle references Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and represents:
- The answer to life, the universe, and everything
- A complete cycle of transformation and renewal
- A manageable number for tracking system evolution

### Why 8D Manifold?
The 8-dimensional space provides:
- Sufficient dimensionality for complex relationships
- Geometric properties useful for indexing
- Mathematical elegance in the projection

### Why No Dependencies?
Stage 0 is intentionally dependency-free to:
- Ensure bootstrap capability from minimal components
- Avoid external attack vectors
- Maintain complete control over the core system
- Enable deployment in constrained environments

## Future Stages

Stage 0 is the foundation for future bootstrap stages:

- **Stage 1**: File I/O and persistent storage
- **Stage 2**: Network communication and distributed coordination
- **Stage 3**: Advanced cryptographic primitives
- **Stage 4**: Plugin system and dynamic loading
- **Stage 5**: Full system integration

## Contributing

1. Maintain zero external dependencies
2. Follow the univalence principle
3. Ensure all components are pluggable
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation for any changes
