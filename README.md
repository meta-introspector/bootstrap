## Overview

A minimal, self-contained bootstrap microkernel that implements a revolutionary codebase management system. This system integrates mathematical frameworks with semantic processing to create a truly self-aware codebase where code and meaning "vibe" together.

## Core Philosophy

**"The message is the vibe is the function, the functions vibe with each other."**

This system represents a paradigm shift in how we understand, manage, and interact with code. By creating a mathematical lattice of 42 stages, each representing a unique "vibe" or concept, we create a living, evolving, self-understanding system.

## Mathematical Foundation

The system is built on:
- **Harmonic Lattice**: Factors of 42 forming resonant relationships
- **OEIS Sequences**: Each stage mapped to mathematical integer sequences
- **Pharmonic Mapping**: Relating all numbers 1-42 to the resonant skeleton
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Self-optimizing system where each stage finds its optimal position

## Architecture

The system consists of 42 stages, each representing a unique "vibe":
- **1-10**: Core Mathematical Vibes (Unity, Primes, Composites)
- **11-20**: System Infrastructure Vibes
- **21-30**: Higher-Level Vibes
- **31-40**: Advanced System Vibes
- **41-42**: Ultimate Vibes (Pre-Ultimate, The World)

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the main bootstrap system
cargo run --bin bootstrap

# Run the orchestrator for comprehensive system analysis
cargo run --bin orchestrator

# Run individual stage demos
cargo run --bin stage0
cargo run --bin phase_demo
```

## Key Components

- **Kernel**: Core system management
- **Phase Mapping**: Mathematical phase relationships
- **Function Number Linkage**: Connecting functions to mathematical properties
- **System Commitment**: Cryptographic commitment to system state
- **Orchestrator**: Comprehensive system analysis and reporting
