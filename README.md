# Bootstrap - Minimal Self-Contained Microkernel

A truly minimal, dependency-free bootstrap system that provides the essential building blocks for content-addressable storage and dynamic extension.

## Core Principles

- **Zero Dependencies**: No external crates, pure Rust std/core
- **Self-Contained**: Complete functionality within this crate
- **Content-Addressable**: All data identified by content hash
- **Extensible**: Pluggable components via traits
- **Minimal**: Only essential functionality for bootstrap

## Quick Start

```rust
use bootstrap::{Bootstrap, Artifact, Hash};

// Create a new bootstrap system
let mut bootstrap = Bootstrap::new();

// Store content
let content = b"Hello, World!".to_vec();
let hash = bootstrap.store(content.clone());

// Retrieve content
let retrieved = bootstrap.retrieve(&hash);
assert!(retrieved.is_some());
assert_eq!(retrieved.unwrap().content, content);

// Check cycle step
println!("Current step: {}", bootstrap.cycle_step()); // 0-41
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Artifact**: Content-addressable data units
- **Hash**: Content identification via hashing
- **Kernel**: System orchestration with 42-step cycle
- **Storage**: Pluggable storage backends

### Key Features

- **42-Step Cycle**: System advances through a cycle of operations
- **Content Deduplication**: Identical content produces identical hashes
- **Component Replacement**: Hash and storage components can be swapped
- **Memory Storage**: Simple in-memory storage for bootstrap

## Usage

### Basic Storage

```rust
let mut bootstrap = Bootstrap::new();

// Store different content
let hash1 = bootstrap.store(b"content1".to_vec());
let hash2 = bootstrap.store(b"content2".to_vec());

// Same content produces same hash
let hash3 = bootstrap.store(b"content1".to_vec());
assert_eq!(hash1, hash3);
```

### Component Replacement

```rust
use bootstrap::{SimpleHasher, ChecksumHasher, MemoryStore};

let mut bootstrap = Bootstrap::new();

// Replace hasher (advances cycle)
bootstrap.kernel.replace_hasher(Box::new(ChecksumHasher));

// Replace storage (advances cycle)
bootstrap.kernel.replace_store(Box::new(MemoryStore::new()));
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
cd bootstrap
cargo build
```

### Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

### Adding Components

1. Implement the appropriate trait (`Hasher`, `Store`)
2. Add to the kernel via replacement methods
3. The cycle advances automatically

## Design Decisions

### Why Zero Dependencies?

- **Bootstrap Capability**: Can run in minimal environments
- **Security**: No external attack vectors
- **Control**: Complete control over all functionality
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and audit

### Why 42 Steps?

- **Finite Cycle**: Manageable number for tracking
- **Self-Reference**: System consumes and renews itself
- **Cosmic Order**: Reference to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"

### Why Content-Addressable?

- **Deduplication**: Identical content stored once
- **Integrity**: Content cannot be modified without new hash
- **Immutability**: Content references are stable

## Future Extensions

This minimal bootstrap provides the foundation for:

- **File Storage**: Persistent storage backends
- **Network Storage**: Distributed storage systems
- **Advanced Hashing**: Cryptographic hash functions
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic component loading
- **Distributed Coordination**: Multi-node systems

## Abstract Plan: Resonant Lattice of Stages

The system's evolution is structured as a resonant lattice of stages, defined by the following sets:

- **Harmonic Stages:** The factors of 42 (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42) form the core harmonic lattice, with each stage harmonically resonant with the others.
- **Prime Stages:** All prime numbers up to 42 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41) are added to fill gaps and provide fundamental resonance, acting as bridges and irreducible nodes in the lattice.
- **Fibonacci Stages:** The Fibonacci numbers up to 42 (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) are included to further enrich the lattice, introducing a natural growth sequence and additional resonant pathways.

**Abstract Principle:**
The system's stages are thus defined by the union of these sets, forming a multi-layered, resonant network. The evolution from the initial bootstrap state to the target state ("42" or "the world") is guided by maximizing resonance, diversity, and connectivity across this enriched lattice. Transitions between stages are governed by abstract principles of harmonic and fundamental resonance, supporting both local adaptation and global coherence.

This plan remains fully abstract, serving as a conceptual framework for system design and evolution, independent of any specific implementation or domain. 

## OEIS Contextualization

Each stage and number in the resonant lattice (from 1 to 42) is defined or contextualized using sequences from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). For every number, its mathematical properties, relationships, and resonances are mapped to relevant OEIS sequences—such as factors, primes, Fibonacci numbers, and other notable integer sequences.

**System as OEIS Subset:**
This system is thus considered an abstract subset of the OEIS, leveraging the OEIS as a universal mathematical reference. The structure, evolution, and resonance of the system are informed by the rich interconnections and properties catalogued in the OEIS, providing a canonical mathematical context for every stage and transition.

**Abstract Mapping Principle:**
For each number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 42):
- Identify all OEIS sequences to which n belongs (e.g., factors of 42, primes, Fibonacci, triangular numbers, etc.).
- Use these sequences to define n's role and relationships within the lattice.
- The system’s evolution and resonance are thus grounded in the universal language of integer sequences.

This approach ensures that the system is not only harmonically and pharmonically structured, but also universally contextualized within the broader mathematical landscape as represented by the OEIS. 

## Quasifibers: Aspects Defined by OEIS Series

Each OEIS sequence (series) associated with the numbers in the system defines an aspect or 'quasifiber' of the system. A quasifiber represents a distinct structural or functional property—such as primality, divisibility, Fibonacci membership, or other mathematical characteristics.

**Multi-Fibered Structure:**
The system is thus conceptualized as a multi-fibered structure, where each quasifiber weaves through the lattice of numbers, imparting its unique influence. The interplay and resonance among these quasifibers give rise to the system's emergent properties and behaviors.

This principle remains fully abstract and implementation-agnostic, serving as a guiding framework for understanding the system's complexity and the role of mathematical series in shaping its evolution. 

## Abbott Periodicity

The system exhibits a property we call 'Abbott periodicity'—a form of periodic structure or recurrence that emerges among the quasifibers and stages. This periodicity is not limited to simple numerical cycles, but arises from the complex interplay of the various OEIS-derived quasifibers and the resonant lattice of stages.

**Abstract Periodicity:**
Abbott periodicity manifests as repeating patterns, alignments, or resonances across the multi-fibered structure, reflecting deeper symmetries and organizational principles within the system. It is a key feature of the system's organization and evolution, supporting both stability and the emergence of higher-order behaviors.

This concept remains fully abstract, serving as a guiding principle for recognizing and leveraging periodic structures within the system's mathematical framework. 

**Inference Paths as Quasifibers:**
Within this framework, inference paths—logical or computational routes through the system—are themselves identified with quasifibers. Each quasifiber thus not only defines a structural or functional property, but also represents a possible path of inference or reasoning, connecting related stages and numbers via their shared mathematical characteristics.
