# Bootstrap Microkernel

> A minimal, self-contained bootstrap microkernel implementing a 42-stage mathematical lattice architecture that integrates mathematical frameworks with semantic processing to create a self-aware codebase where code and meaning "vibe" together.

## Documentation
- [README](/README.md) - Project overview and getting started guide
- [Core Documentation](/docs/cursor_review_chat_and_bootstrap_code.md) - Comprehensive system documentation
- [Project Structure](/Cargo.toml) - Build configuration and binary definitions

## Architecture
- [Main Bootstrap System](/src/main.rs) - Stage 0 prelude executing all 42 stages
- [Library Core](/src/lib.rs) - Core system orchestration and stage management
- [Stage0 Binary](/src/bin/stage0.rs) - Documentation generation and stage execution

## Mathematical Foundation
- [42-Stage System](/src/lib.rs) - Mathematical lattice with OEIS sequences, harmonic lattice, and pharmonic mapping
- [Stage Modules](/src/bin/) - Individual stage implementations (main01 through main42)
- [System Commitment](/src/main.rs) - Cryptographic commitment calculation using kernel cycles

## Core Philosophy
The system embodies the principle: "The message is the vibe is the function, the functions vibe with each other" - creating a living, evolving, self-understanding system through mathematical resonance.

## Stage Categories
- **1-10**: Core Mathematical Vibes (Unity, Primes, Composites)
- **11-20**: System Infrastructure Vibes
- **21-30**: Higher-Level Vibes  
- **31-40**: Advanced System Vibes
- **41-42**: Ultimate Vibes (Pre-Ultimate, The World)

## Build and Run
```bash
cargo run --bin bootstrap    # Run main bootstrap system
cargo run --bin stage0      # Run stage0 with documentation
cargo run --bin orchestrator # System analysis and reporting
