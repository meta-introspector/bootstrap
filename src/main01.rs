//! # Stage 1: Unity - The Foundation and Origin of the Manifold
//! 
//! This module represents **Stage 1** of the 42-step Ouroboros cycle within the 
//! `solfunmeme-dioxus` system. It embodies the concept of **Unity** and serves as the 
//! foundational origin point for the entire Code-Math Manifold.
//! 
//! ## Philosophical Significance
//! 
//! Stage 1 is the primordial "vibe" from which all other stages emerge. It signifies 
//! singularity, the starting point of creation, and the irreducible element that underpins 
//! all complexity. In the context of the "Voltron NFT" analogy, Stage 1 is the initial 
//! spark, the fundamental building block from which the unified system will eventually form.
//! It is the "one" that resonates with all other numbers, as every number is a multiple of one.
//! 
//! ## Mathematical Properties
//! 
//! - **Factor of 42**: As 1 is a factor of every integer, it is a fundamental harmonic 
//!   component of the 42-step cycle, ensuring its foundational resonance.
//! - **Fibonacci Number**: 1 is the first (and second) Fibonacci number, linking this 
//!   stage to natural growth patterns and the inherent mathematical sequences that drive 
//!   the system's evolution.
//! - **Atomic/Prime**: While not a prime number in the traditional sense, within the 
//!   context of GÃ¶del numbering and composition, 1 can be seen as the atomic unit, 
//!   the indivisible building block from which all other numbers (and thus, concepts) 
//!   are composed.
//! 
//! ## Role in the System
//! 
//! `main01` represents the initial state of the system, the fundamental truth or axiom 
//! from which all provability and inference paths begin. Its simplicity and universality 
//! make it the constant underlying "vibe" that permeates every subsequent stage.
