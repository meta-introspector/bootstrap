
//! # Mathematical Provability
//!
//! The structure and properties of the systemâ€”its resonant lattice, quasifibers, periodicity, and inference pathsâ€”can be rigorously analyzed and proven within mathematics.
//! Each number's membership in various OEIS sequences is a mathematical fact, and the relationships among numbers can be described using number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.
//! The mapping of inference paths to quasifibers is provable by demonstrating that logical or computational paths correspond to sequences of shared properties.

/// Example: Checks if a number is provable as a member of a given quasifiber (abstract placeholder).
