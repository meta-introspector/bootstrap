//!
//! Inference paths within the system correspond to quasifibers. Each quasifiber represents not only a structural or functional property, but also a possible path of inference or reasoning through the system.
//! Logical or computational routes connect related stages and numbers via their shared mathematical characteristics.

/// Example: Returns a path of inference (as a sequence of numbers) along a given quasifiber (e.g., primes).
