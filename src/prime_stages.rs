
//! # Prime Stages
//!
//! Prime Stages are defined as all prime numbers up to 42 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41).
//! These primes act as fundamental nodes or bridges in the lattice, providing irreducible connections between stages.
//! This concept is rooted in number theory and enriches the system's resonance and connectivity.

/// Returns the prime numbers up to 42 as fundamental nodes.
