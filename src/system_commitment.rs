//! # System Commitment Module: The Grand Polynomial of the Manifold
//! 
//! This module provides a conceptual function to calculate a single, large numerical
//! "commitment" to the entire `solfunmeme-dioxus` system's state. Inspired by the idea
//! of a "big polynomial number" for a commitment scheme, this value encapsulates the
//! collective "vibe" and mathematical properties of all 42 stages and core components.
//! 
//! ## Philosophical Significance
//! 
//! This commitment value represents the system's current "Voltron" stateâ€”the unified
//! emergent entity formed by the harmonious interplay of its individual parts. It's a
//! numerical fingerprint of the Code-Math Manifold at any given moment, allowing for
//! self-reflection and verification of the system's integrity and evolution. Changes
//! to any underlying "lion" (stage or component) would deterministically alter this
//! grand polynomial number, making it a powerful tool for tracking the system's
//! self-modification and emergent properties.
//! 
//! ## Calculation Principle
//! 
//! The commitment is derived by combining the inherent "vibe" (numerical properties)
//! of each of the 42 stages with the current state of the system (e.g., the cycle step).
//! While not a literal polynomial evaluation in the traditional sense (due to `u128`
//! limitations for very large numbers), it acts as a unique, deterministic aggregation
//! that "commits" to the system's overall configuration.
