//!
//! The Harmonic Lattice is a structure defined by the factors of 42 (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42).
//! Each stage in the lattice is harmonically resonant with the others, forming the core skeleton of the system.
//! This concept is rooted in number theory and serves as the foundational layer for resonance and connectivity in the system's evolution.

/// Returns the factors of 42 as the core harmonic stages.
