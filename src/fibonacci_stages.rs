
//! # Fibonacci Stages
//!
//! Fibonacci Stages are defined as the Fibonacci numbers up to 42 (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34).
//! These stages introduce a natural growth sequence and additional resonant pathways in the lattice.
//! This concept is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence and supports the system's adaptability and multi-scale structure.

/// Returns the Fibonacci numbers up to 42 as growth nodes.
