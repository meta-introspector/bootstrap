
//! # Abbott Periodicity
//!
//! Abbott Periodicity is a form of periodic structure or recurrence that emerges among the quasifibers and stages.
//! This periodicity arises from the interplay of OEIS-derived quasifibers and the resonant lattice, manifesting as repeating patterns and alignments.
//! It is a key feature of the system's organization and evolution, supporting stability and higher-order behaviors.

/// Example: Checks for periodicity in a sequence (abstract placeholder).
pub fn is_periodic(sequence: &[u32]) -> bool {
    // Placeholder: In a real system, implement periodicity detection logic.
    sequence.len() > 1 && sequence[0] == sequence[sequence.len() - 1]
